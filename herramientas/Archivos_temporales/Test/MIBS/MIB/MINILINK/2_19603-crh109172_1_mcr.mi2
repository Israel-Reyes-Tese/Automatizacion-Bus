			DESCRIPTION
				"
				This MIB is the top level MIB for MCR Link in MINI LINK Traffic Node.
			
				MMU2 is a MINI-LINK Traffic Node MCR Modem Unit, 
				it can work alone in a 1+0 configuration or, 
				together with another MMU2 and a SMU2,
				in a 1+1 configuration. 
				See XF-TMU-MIB (xfTMU).
				
				SMU2is a MINI-LINK MCR Protection and Co siting Unit, allowing
				together with two MMU2s a 1+1 MCR configuration. SMU2 can also be 
				configured to co-site an external ML-E equipment. 
				See XF-PCU-MIB (xfPCU).
				
				The syntax (textual conventions) of unique MCR MOs is specified here.
