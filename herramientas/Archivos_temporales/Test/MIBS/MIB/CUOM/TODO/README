Subject: VMWARE SNMP MIB MODULES

This directory contains mib modules
for VMWARE products in SMIv2 (RFC 2578) compliant format.
Mibs module files may also be distributed by the individual VMware products.
Use the REVISION clause in the MIB module to determine which is the latest
version to install. MIB modules are always backward compatible.

To load these into various management stations
software use this suggested order to prevent any lookup
errors.

For any given VMware product (ESX, VCHA, NSX-MANAGER)
and version release, to find the set of MIB modules it supports
please review the agent capability *-AGENTCAP-MIB file.

ESXi
   VMWARE-ESX-AGENTCAP-MIB.mib -- describes the ESXi agent since ESX 5.1 (2009)

Virtual Center Management
   VMWARE-VA-AGENTCAP-MIB.mib  -- describes SNMPv1/v2/v3 agent since VSPHERE 6.0 (2015)

NSX Manager
   VMWARE-NSX-MANAGER-AGENTCAP-MIB.mib -- describes the SNMPv2c trap only agent in NSX-Manager (2016)

vRealize Operations IT Operations Management
   tbd.

Note: loading the latest version of any given mib module should provide backward compatiblity
for prior releases. Only one MIB module (NSX-MANAGER) presently may not follow SNMP backward
compatiblity rules.
