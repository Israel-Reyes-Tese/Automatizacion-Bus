mteTriggerDeltaDiscontinuityID:
  DESCRIPTION: The OBJECT IDENTIFIER (OID) of a TimeTicks, TimeStamp, or DateAndTime object that indicates a discontinuity in the value at mteTriggerValueID. The OID may be for a leaf object (e.g. sysUpTime.0) or may be wildcarded to match mteTriggerValueID. This object supports normal checking for a discontinuity in a counter.  Note that if this object does not point to sysUpTime discontinuity checking MUST still check sysUpTime for an overall discontinuity. If the object identified is not accessible the sample attempt is in error, with the error code as from an SNMP request. Bad object identifiers or a mismatch between truncating the identifier and the value of mteDeltaDiscontinuityIDWildcard result in operation as one would expect when providing the wrong identifier to a Get operation.  The Get will fail or get the wrong object.  If the value syntax of those objects is not usable, that results in an error that terminates the sample with a 'badType' error code."

For 'existence', the specific test is as selected by mteTriggerExistenceTest.  When an object appears, vanishes or changes value, the trigger fires. If the object's appearance caused the trigger firing, the object MUST vanish before the trigger can be fired again for it, and vice versa. If the trigger fired due to a change in the object's value, it will be fired again on every successive value change for that object. For 'boolean', the specific test is as selected by mteTriggerBooleanTest.  If the test result is true the trigger fires.  The trigger will not fire again until the value has become false and come back to true. For 'threshold' the test works as described below for mteTriggerThresholdStartup, mteTriggerThresholdRising, and mteTriggerThresholdFalling.

For example use 'Repeater' to wildcard to 'Repeater1', 'Repeater2', 'Repeater-999.87b', and so on.  To indicate such wildcarding is intended, mteTriggerContextNameWildcard must be 'true'. Each instance that fills the wildcard is independent of any additional instances, that is, wildcarded objects operate as if there were a separate table entry for each instance that fills the wildcard without having to actually predict all possible instances ahead of time. Operation of this feature assumes that the local system has a list of available contexts against which to apply the wildcard.  If the objects are being read from the local system, this is clearly the system's own list of contexts. For a remote system a local version of such a list is not defined by any current standard and may not be available, so this function MAY not be supported." DEFVAL { ''H }

  SYNTAX: SEQUENCE OF HrStorageEntry
  STATUS: current
  DESCRIPTION: The (conceptual) table of logical storage areas on the host. An entry shall be placed in the storage table for each logical area of storage that is allocated and has fixed resource limits.  The amount of storage represented in an entity is the amount actually usable by the requesting entity, and excludes loss due to formatting or file system reference information. These entries are associated with logical storage areas, as might be seen by an application, rather than physical storage entities which are typically seen by an operating system.  Storage such as tapes and floppies without file systems on them are typically not allocated in chunks by the operating system to requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't appear in this table.  Examples of valid storage for this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram (for some architectures this is further segmented into regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing store for virtual memory (`swap space'). This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic for `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of failures.  In addition, it can be a useful performance monitoring tool for tracking memory, disk, or buffer usage.

For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer.  (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active

Each instance that fills the wildcard is independent of any additional instances, that is, wildcarded objects operate as if there were a separate table entry for each instance that fills the wildcard without having to actually predict all possible instances ahead of time. Bad object identifiers or a mismatch between truncating the identifier and the value of mteSetObjectWildcard result in operation as one would expect when providing the wrong identifier to a Set operation.

When a message is sent to this address, and a response (if one is expected) is not received within this time period, an implementation may assume that the response will not be delivered. Note that the time interval that an application waits for a response may actually be derived from the value of this object.  The method for deriving the actual time interval is implementation dependent.  One such method is to derive the expected round trip time based on a particular retransmission algorithm and on the number of timeouts which have occurred.  The type of message may also be considered when deriving expected round trip times for retransmissions.  For example, if a message is being sent with a securityLevel that indicates both authentication and privacy, the derived value may be increased to compensate for extra processing time spent during authentication and encryption processing."

This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media.  The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media.  If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.

The precise conditions under which this counter is incremented (if at all) depend on how the SNMP entity implements its access control mechanism and how its applications interact with that access control mechanism.  It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the documentation for any access control mechanism which is used to control access to and visibility of MIB instrumentation specify the precise conditions that contribute to this value.

  DESCRIPTION: The number of seconds to wait between trigger samples.  To encourage consistency in sampling, the interval is measured from the beginning of one check to the beginning of the next and the timer is restarted immediately when it expires, not when the check completes. If the next sample begins before the previous one completed the system may either attempt to make the check or treat this as an error condition with the error 'sampleOverrun'. A frequency of 0 indicates instantaneous recognition of the condition.  This is not possible in many cases, but may be supported in cases where it makes sense and the system is able to do so.  This feature allows the MIB to be used in implementations where such interrupt-driven behavior is possible and is not likely to be supported for all MIB objects even then since such sampling generally has to be tightly integrated into low-level code. Systems that can support this SHOULD document those cases where it can be used.  In cases where it can not, setting this object to 0 should be disallowed." DEFVAL { 600 }

A 'deltaValue' requires two samples to be meaningful and is thus not available for testing until the second and subsequent samples after the object at mteTriggerValueID is first found to exist.  It is the difference between the two samples.  For unsigned values it is always positive, based on unsigned arithmetic.  For signed values it can be positive or negative. For SNMP counters to be meaningful they should be sampled as a 'deltaValue'. For 'deltaValue' mteTriggerDeltaTable contains further parameters.

  DESCRIPTION: The status of this conceptual row. To create a row in this table, a manager must set this object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5). Until instances of all corresponding columns are appropriately configured, the value of the corresponding instance of the snmpTargetAddrRowStatus column is 'notReady'. In particular, a newly created row cannot be made active until the corresponding instances of snmpTargetAddrTDomain, snmpTargetAddrTAddress, and snmpTargetAddrParams have all been set. The following objects may not be modified while the value of this object is active(1): - snmpTargetAddrTDomain - snmpTargetAddrTAddress An attempt to set these objects while the value of snmpTargetAddrRowStatus is active(1) will result in an inconsistentValue error.

ifAlias:
  ARCHIVO: IF-MIB.mib
  SYNTAX: DisplayString (SIZE(0..64))
  MAX-ACCESS: read-write
  DESCRIPTION: This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string.  As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType.  An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.

  STATUS: current
  OID: ifEntry 19
  DESCRIPTION: The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted.  One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

sysServices:
  SYNTAX: INTEGER (0..127)
  MAX-ACCESS: read-only
  ARCHIVO: SNMPv2-MIB.mib
  STATUS: current
  DESCRIPTION: A value which indicates the set of services that this entity may potentially offer.  The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum.  For example, a node which performs only routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer      functionality 1        physical (e.g., repeaters) 2        datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3        internet (e.g., supports the IP) 4        end-to-end  (e.g., supports the TCP) 7        applications (e.g., supports the SMTP) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.

ifTestTable:
  MAX-ACCESS: not-accessible
  SYNTAX: SEQUENCE OF IfTestEntry
  ARCHIVO: IF-MIB.mib
  OID: ifMIBObjects 3
  DESCRIPTION: This table contains one entry per interface.  It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) }

  OBJECTS: mteHotTrigger, mteHotTargetName, mteHotContextName, mteHotOID, mteHotValue 
  VARIABLES: No se encontraron variables
  STATUS: current
  OID: dismanEventMIBNotifications 2
  DESCRIPTION: Notification that the rising threshold was met for triggers with mteTriggerType 'threshold'.

ucdStart:
  OBJECTS: No se encontraron objetos
  VARIABLES: No se encontraron variables
  STATUS: current
  DESCRIPTION: This trap could in principle be sent when the agent start

  TYPE: NOTIFICATION-TYPE

linkDown:
  OBJECTS: ifIndex, ifAdminStatus, ifOperStatus 
  VARIABLES: No se encontraron variables
  STATUS: current
  DESCRIPTION: A linkDown trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for one of its communication links is about to enter the down state from some other state (but not from the notPresent state).  This other state is indicated by the included value of ifOperStatus.
  OID: snmpTraps 3
  TYPE: NOTIFICATION-TYPE

mteEventSetFailure:
  OBJECTS: mteHotTrigger, mteHotTargetName, mteHotContextName, mteHotOID, mteFailedReason 
  VARIABLES: No se encontraron variables
  STATUS: current
  OID: dismanEventMIBNotifications 5
  DESCRIPTION: Notification that an attempt to do a set in response to an event has failed. The network manager must enable this notification only with a certain fear and trembling, as it can easily crowd out more important information.  It should be used only to help diagnose a problem that has appeared in the error counters and can not be found otherwise.
