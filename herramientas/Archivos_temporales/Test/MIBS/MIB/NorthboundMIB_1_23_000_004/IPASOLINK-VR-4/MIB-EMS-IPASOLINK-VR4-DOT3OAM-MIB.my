            "This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on the
             interface via the provDot3OamPortEnabled.
    
             If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs with
             a link fault indication or the interface is not operational, the
             value is linkFault(2).
    
             The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in
             passive mode and reflects the state in which the OAM entity is
             waiting to see if the peer device is OA capable. The
             activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode trying to
             discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has not yet made
             that determination.
    
             The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OA entity
             has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or rejected the
             configuration of the peer. The local device can, for whatever
             reason, decide that the peer device is unacceptable and decline
             OAM peering. If the local OAM entity rejects the peer OAM entity,
             the state becomes oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7). If the OAM
             peering is allowed by the local device, the state moves to
             sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6).
    
             If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state becomes
             oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8). When the local OAM entity learns
             that both it and the remote OAM entity have accepted the peering,
             the state moves to operational(9). Since Ethernet OAM functions
             are not designed to work completely over half-duplex interfaces,
             the value nonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM
             is enabled, but the interface is in half-duplex operation."
