STATUS      current
DESCRIPTION
"This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as
specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile
'handle' for the interface.
On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of
ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length
string.  As and when a value is written into an instance of
ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the
agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance
associated with the same interface for as long as that
interface remains instantiated, including across all re-
initializations/reboots of the network management system,
including those which result in a change of the interface's
ifIndex value.
An example of the value which a network manager might store
in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit
number/identifier of the interface.
Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces
having particular values of ifType.  An agent which supports
write access to this object is required to keep the value in
non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new
values depending on how much storage is already occupied by
the current values for other interfaces."

corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.  For
example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over
the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table
contains:
ifStackStatus.x.y=active
For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active
interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows
in this table associated with I.  For one of these rows, I
is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the
value of ifStackLowerLayer.  (If I is not involved in
multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated
with I.)
For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has
no others stacked on top or below it:
ifStackStatus.0.x=active
ifStackStatus.x.0=active "

SYNTAX      SEQUENCE OF IfTestEntry
MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
STATUS      deprecated
DESCRIPTION
"This table contains one entry per interface.  It defines
objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent
to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an
interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that
interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult
can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not
perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The
object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-
specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)
information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one
test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.
If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the
second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when
a prior test is active on another interface.
Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain
'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the
interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the
ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows:
try_again:
get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
while (ifTestStatus != notInUse)
/*
* Loop while a test is running or some other
* manager is configuring a test.
*/
short delay
get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
}
/*
* Is not being used right now -- let's compete
* to see who gets it.
*/
lock_value = ifTestId
if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse,
ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE)
/*
* Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go
* try again
*/
goto try_again;
/*
* I have the lock
*/
set up any test parameters.
/*
* This starts the test
*/
set(ifTestType = test_to_run);
wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult
when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult
agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'
retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId
if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid
A manager station first retrieves the value of the
appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically
repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of
ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The manager station then tries
to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just
retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the
corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating
itself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has
obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the
ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the
semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation
indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of
the ifTestEntry.
Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be
setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType.
On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to
'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the
results.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests
by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be
a possibility that the first test's results might be
overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first
results being read.  This unlikely circumstance can be
detected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the
same time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that
the results are for the desired request.
If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of
time after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out
the manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object
back to 'notInUse'.  It is suggested that this time-out
period be 5 minutes.
In general, a management station must not retransmit a
request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a
response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's MIB to
determine if the invocation was successful.  Only if the
invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request
retransmitted.
Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in
order to execute them, or may even require the agent to
reboot after completion of the test.  In these
circumstances, communication with the management station
invoking the test may be lost until after completion of the
test.  An agent is not required to support such tests.
However, if such tests are supported, then the agent should
make every effort to transmit a response to the request
which invoked the test prior to losing communication.  When
the agent is restored to normal service, the results of the
test are properly made available in the appropriate objects.
Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to
an interface must be unchanged even if the test causes a
reboot.  An agent must reject any test for which it cannot,
perhaps due to resource constraints, make available at least
the minimum amount of information after that test
completes."

This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts
all packets/frames transmitted on the media.  The value
true(1) is only legal on certain types of media.  If legal,
setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the
interface to be reset before becoming effective.
The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception
of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.

ifTestTable:
  SYNTAX: SEQUENCE OF IfTestEntry
  STATUS: deprecated
  DESCRIPTION: This table contains one entry per interface.  It defines
objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent
to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an
interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that
interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult
can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not
perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The
object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-
specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)
information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one
test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.
If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the
second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when
a prior test is active on another interface.
Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain
'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the
interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the
ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows:
try_again:
get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
while (ifTestStatus != notInUse)
/*
* Loop while a test is running or some other
* manager is configuring a test.
*/
short delay
get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
}
/*
* Is not being used right now -- let's compete
* to see who gets it.
*/
lock_value = ifTestId
if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse,
ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE)
/*
* Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go
* try again
*/
goto try_again;
/*
* I have the lock
*/
set up any test parameters.
/*
* This starts the test
*/
set(ifTestType = test_to_run);
wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult
when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult
agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'
retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId
if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid
A manager station first retrieves the value of the
appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically
repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of
ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The manager station then tries
to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just
retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the
corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating
itself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has
obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the
ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the
semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation
indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of
the ifTestEntry.
Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be
setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType.
On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to
'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the
results.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests
by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be
a possibility that the first test's results might be
overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first
results being read.  This unlikely circumstance can be
detected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the
same time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that
the results are for the desired request.
If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of
time after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out
the manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object
back to 'notInUse'.  It is suggested that this time-out
period be 5 minutes.
In general, a management station must not retransmit a
request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a
response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's MIB to
determine if the invocation was successful.  Only if the
invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request
retransmitted.
Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in
order to execute them, or may even require the agent to
reboot after completion of the test.  In these
circumstances, communication with the management station
invoking the test may be lost until after completion of the
test.  An agent is not required to support such tests.
However, if such tests are supported, then the agent should
make every effort to transmit a response to the request
which invoked the test prior to losing communication.  When
the agent is restored to normal service, the results of the
test are properly made available in the appropriate objects.
Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to
an interface must be unchanged even if the test causes a
reboot.  An agent must reject any test for which it cannot,
perhaps due to resource constraints, make available at least
the minimum amount of information after that test
completes.

required, for the address which has the functional address
bit ANDed with the bit mask of all functional addresses for
which the interface will accept frames.
A system is normally able to use any unicast address which
corresponds to an entry in this table as a source address.

  DESCRIPTION: This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as
specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile
'handle' for the interface.
On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of
ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length
string.  As and when a value is written into an instance of
ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the
agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance
associated with the same interface for as long as that
interface remains instantiated, including across all re-
initializations/reboots of the network management system,
including those which result in a change of the interface's
ifIndex value.
An example of the value which a network manager might store
in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit
number/identifier of the interface.
Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces
having particular values of ifType.  An agent which supports
write access to this object is required to keep the value in
non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new
values depending on how much storage is already occupied by
the current values for other interfaces.

ifSpeed:
  SYNTAX: Gauge32
  STATUS: current
  DESCRIPTION: An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits
per second.  For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth
or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this
object should contain the nominal bandwidth.  If the
bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value
reportable by this object then this object should report its
maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used
to report the interace's speed.  For a sub-layer which has
no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.

  DESCRIPTION: Information on a particular relationship between two sub-
layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the
other sub-layer.  Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual
row in the ifTable.

ifIndex:
  SYNTAX: InterfaceIndex
  STATUS: current
  DESCRIPTION: A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface.  It
is recommended that values are assigned contiguously
starting from 1.  The value for each interface sub-layer
must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of
the entity's network management system to the next re-
initialization.

ifInDiscards:
  SYNTAX: Counter32
  STATUS: current
  DESCRIPTION: The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be
discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent
their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol.  One
possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to
free up buffer space.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at
re-initialization of the management system, and at other
times as indicated by the value of
ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

ifCounterDiscontinuityTime:
  SYNTAX: TimeStamp
  STATUS: current
  DESCRIPTION: The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which
any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a
discontinuity.  The relevant counters are the specific
instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or
Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable.  If
no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re-
initialization of the local management subsystem, then this
object contains a zero value.
