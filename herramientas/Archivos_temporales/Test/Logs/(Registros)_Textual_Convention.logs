DESCRIPTION
"This data type is used to model an administratively
assigned name of the owner of a resource.  This information
is taken from the NVT ASCII character set.  It is suggested
that this name contain one or more of the following: ASCII
form of the manager station's transport address, management
station name (e.g., domain name), network management
personnel's name, location, or phone number.  In some cases
the agent itself will be the owner of an entry.  In these
cases, this string shall be set to a string starting with
'agent'."
SYNTAX       OCTET STRING (SIZE(0..255))
-- InterfaceIndex contains the semantics of ifIndex and should be used
-- for any objects defined in other MIB modules that need these semantics.
InterfaceIndex ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
DISPLAY-HINT "d"
STATUS       current
DESCRIPTION
"A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface or
interface sub-layer in the managed system.  It is
recommended that values are assigned contiguously starting
from 1.  The value for each interface sub-layer must remain
constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's
network management system to the next re-initialization."

DISPLAY-HINT "d"
STATUS       current
DESCRIPTION
"This textual convention is an extension of the
InterfaceIndex convention.  The latter defines a greater
than zero value used to identify an interface or interface
sub-layer in the managed system.  This extension permits the
additional value of zero.  the value zero is object-specific
and must therefore be defined as part of the description of
any object which uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of
zero might include situations where interface was unknown,
or when none or all interfaces need to be referenced."
