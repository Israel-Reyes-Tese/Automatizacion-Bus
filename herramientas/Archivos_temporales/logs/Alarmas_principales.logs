----------------------------------- ALARM TRAPS ---------------------------
authenticationFailure:
  OBJECTS: No se encontraron objetos
  OID: 1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.5
  DESCRIPTION: An authenticationFailure trap signifies that the SNMP entity has received a protocol message that is not properly authenticated.  While all implementations of SNMP entities MAY be capable of generating this trap, the snmpEnableAuthenTraps object indicates whether this trap will be generated.

mteTriggerRising:
  OBJECTS: mteHotTrigger, mteHotTargetName, mteHotContextName, mteHotOID, mteHotValue 
  OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.88.2.0.2
  DESCRIPTION: Notification that the rising threshold was met for triggers with mteTriggerType 'threshold'.

ucdStart:
  OBJECTS: No se encontraron objetos
  DESCRIPTION: This trap could in principle be sent when the agent start
  OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.251.1

linkDown:
  OID: 1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.3
  DESCRIPTION: A linkDown trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for one of its communication links is about to enter the down state from some other state (but not from the notPresent state).  This other state is indicated by the included value of ifOperStatus.
  OBJECTS: ifIndex, ifAdminStatus, ifOperStatus 

mteEventSetFailure:
  OBJECTS: mteHotTrigger, mteHotTargetName, mteHotContextName, mteHotOID, mteFailedReason 
  OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.88.2.0.5
  DESCRIPTION: Notification that an attempt to do a set in response to an event has failed. The network manager must enable this notification only with a certain fear and trembling, as it can easily crowd out more important information.  It should be used only to help diagnose a problem that has appeared in the error counters and can not be found otherwise.

warmStart:
  OID: 1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.2
  DESCRIPTION: A warmStart trap signifies that the SNMP entity, supporting a notification originator application, is reinitializing itself such that its configuration is unaltered.
  OBJECTS: No se encontraron objetos

mteTriggerFired:
  OBJECTS: mteHotTrigger, mteHotTargetName, mteHotContextName, mteHotOID, mteHotValue 
  OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.88.2.0.1
  DESCRIPTION: Notification that the trigger indicated by the object instances has fired, for triggers with mteTriggerType 'boolean' or 'existence'.

ucdShutdown:
  OBJECTS: No se encontraron objetos
  DESCRIPTION: This trap is sent when the agent terminates
  OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.251.2

mteTriggerFalling:
  OBJECTS: mteHotTrigger, mteHotTargetName, mteHotContextName, mteHotOID, mteHotValue 
  OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.88.2.0.3
  DESCRIPTION: Notification that the falling threshold was met for triggers with mteTriggerType 'threshold'.

linkUp:
  OBJECTS: ifIndex, ifAdminStatus, ifOperStatus 
  OID: 1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.4
  DESCRIPTION: A linkUp trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for one of its communication links left the down state and transitioned into some other state (but not into the notPresent state).  This other state is indicated by the included value of ifOperStatus.

mteTriggerFailure:
  DESCRIPTION: Notification that an attempt to check a trigger has failed. The network manager must enable this notification only with a certain fear and trembling, as it can easily crowd out more important information.  It should be used only to help diagnose a problem that has appeared in the error counters and can not be found otherwise.
  OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.88.2.0.4
  OBJECTS: mteHotTrigger, mteHotTargetName, mteHotContextName, mteHotOID, mteFailedReason 

coldStart:
  DESCRIPTION: A coldStart trap signifies that the SNMP entity, supporting a notification originator application, is reinitializing itself and that its configuration may have been altered.
  OID: 1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.1
  OBJECTS: No se encontraron objetos
