    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention is an extension of the
        Ipv6IfIndex convention.  The latter defines
        a greater than zero value used to identify an IPv6
        interface in the managed system.  This extension
        permits the additional value of zero.  The value
        zero is object-specific and must therefore be
        defined as part of the description of any object
        which uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of
        zero might include situations where interface was
        unknown, or when none or all interfaces need to be
        referenced."

   STATUS     current
   DESCRIPTION
        "An index object used to disambiguate conceptual rows in
         the table, since the connection 4-tuple may not be unique.

         If the connection's remote address (ipv6TcpConnRemAddress)
         is a link-local address and the connection's local address
         (ipv6TcpConnLocalAddress) is not a link-local address, this
         object identifies a local interface on the same link as
         the connection's remote link-local address.

         Otherwise, this object identifies the local interface that
         is associated with the ipv6TcpConnLocalAddress for this
         TCP connection.  If such a local interface cannot be determined,
         this object should take on the value 0.  (A possible example
         of this would be if the value of ipv6TcpConnLocalAddress is ::0.)

         The interface identified by a particular non-0 value of this
         index is the same interface as identified by the same value
         of ipv6IfIndex.

         The value of this object must remain constant during the life
         of the TCP connection."

   DESCRIPTION
        "The state of this TCP connection.

         The only value which may be set by a management station is
         deleteTCB(12).  Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent
         to return an error response (`badValue' for SNMPv1, 'wrongValue'
         for SNMPv2) if a management station attempts to set this
         object to any other value.

         If a management station sets this object to the value
         deleteTCB(12), then this has the effect of deleting the TCB
         (as defined in RFC 793) of the corresponding connection on
         the managed node, resulting in immediate termination of the
         connection.

         As an implementation-specific option, a RST segment may be
         sent from the managed node to the other TCP endpoint (note
         however that RST segments are not sent reliably)."
